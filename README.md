# Cancer Cell Classification using Scikit-learn

### Overview
This project aims to classify cancer cells into two categories: malignant and benign. It utilizes the Scikit-learn library, a powerful tool for machine learning in Python. The classification is based on features extracted from breast cancer data.

### Setup
To get started, ensure you have Scikit-learn installed in your Python environment. You can install it via pip:

```
pip install scikit-learn
```

### Usage

1. Importing Necessary Modules and Dataset:
    - We begin by importing the required modules, including Scikit-learn.
    - The dataset used in this project is loaded using Scikit-learn's load_breast_cancer function.

2. Organizing the Data and Examining It:
   - The data is organized into respective variables, including features and labels.
   - We print out the label names, labels, feature names, and features to understand the structure of our data.

3. Organizing the Data into Sets:
   - The dataset is split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

4. Building the Model:
   - We import the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier from Scikit-learn.
   - The classifier is initialized and trained on the training data.
   - Predictions are made on the test data using the trained model.

5. Evaluating the Trained Modelâ€™s Accuracy:
   - Finally, the accuracy of the trained model is evaluated using Scikit-learn's accuracy_score function.

### Future Works
- Further exploration of different machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Feature engineering and selection to improve model performance.
- Deployment of the model in production environments.
### Research
- Investigate advanced techniques for cancer cell classification.
- Explore ensemble learning methods for improved accuracy.
- Dive into deep learning approaches for more complex feature extraction.
### Usage
1. Install the necessary dependencies (scikit-learn, etc.).
2. Clone the repository.
3. Execute the provided code snippets or integrate them into your own scripts.

### Conclusion
With an accuracy score of approximately 94%, the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier demonstrates promising results in classifying cancer cells based on the provided dataset. Further experimentation and tuning may improve the model's performance.
